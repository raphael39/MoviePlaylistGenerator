<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Have you ever worried if you could find the soundtracks of the movie that you were lost in time while watching it? Don't worry we've got you! Your favorite playlist of all time is just a few clicks away from you. 

Here's why:
* We are in a time that movie production is way more beyond our playlist and this app allows you to explore all the different soundtrack that you could ever wonder without too much where to find.
* You shouldn't be looking for one single song after the one another and adding them mannually, which is a big loss of time in the time we are living
